# Route-Based Station Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the updated implementation of station-based booking filtering that uses the starting point of the route instead of a separate boarding point field. This approach is more accurate and aligns with how passengers actually book their journeys.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Query Modification
The filtering logic in `Admin/today_bookings.php` has been updated to extract the starting station directly from the route field:

**Before:**
```sql
AND boarding_point = 'Station Name'
```

**After:**
```sql
AND SUBSTRING_INDEX(route, '-', 1) = 'starting_station'
```

This extracts the first part of the route (before the dash) to determine the starting station.

### 2. Display Changes
The admin interface now shows "Starting Station" instead of "Boarding Point" and extracts this value from the route:

**Before:**
```php
htmlspecialchars($row['boarding_point'] ?? '')
```

**After:**
```php
htmlspecialchars(ucfirst(substr($row['route'], 0, strpos($row['route'], '-') !== false ? strpos($row['route'], '-') : strlen($row['route']))))
```

### 3. Route Standardization
All routes should follow the format `startingstation-destination`, for example:
- `litein-nairobi`
- `nairobi-kisumu`
- `kisumu-nairobi`

## How It Works

### For Passengers
When a passenger selects a route (e.g., "Litein - Nairobi"), the system stores this as `litein-nairobi` in the route field.

### For Admins
When an admin views today's bookings:
1. The system extracts the starting station from the route (e.g., "litein" from "litein-nairobi")
2. It compares this with the admin's assigned station
3. Only bookings where the starting station matches the admin's station are displayed

### Example Scenarios

1. **Passenger books "Litein - Nairobi" route:**
   - Route stored as: `litein-nairobi`
   - Starting station extracted as: `litein`
   - Only admins with station = "Litein" will see this booking

2. **Passenger books "Nairobi - Kisumu" route:**
   - Route stored as: `nairobi-kisumu`
   - Starting station extracted as: `nairobi`
   - Only admins with station = "Nairobi" will see this booking

## Files Modified

1. **Admin/today_bookings.php** - Updated query and display logic
2. **fix_existing_booking_route.php** - Script to fix existing bookings
3. **update_all_booking_routes.php** - Script to standardize all routes

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Run the Fix Script
```
http://localhost/southrift/fix_existing_booking_route.php
```

### 2. Verify with Diagnostic Script
```
http://localhost/southrift/diagnose_station_filtering.php
```

### 3. Log in as Admins
- Litein Admin: adminlitein@gmail.com (password: password)
- Nairobi Admin: adminnairobi@gmail.com (password: password)

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Accuracy**: Uses the actual starting point of the journey
2. **Consistency**: Eliminates discrepancies between boarding point and route
3. **Simplicity**: No need to maintain separate boarding point data
4. **Automatic**: Extracts station information directly from route

## Route Format Standards

All routes should follow these standardized formats:

| Route | Starting Station | Destination |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| litein-nairobi | Litein | Nairobi |
| nairobi-kisumu | Nairobi | Kisumu |
| nairobi-nakuru | Nairobi | Nakuru |
| kisumu-nairobi | Kisumu | Nairobi |
| nakuru-nairobi | Nakuru | Nairobi |
| bomet-nairobi | Bomet | Nairobi |
| nairobi-bomet | Nairobi | Bomet |

## Troubleshooting

### If Admins Don't See Bookings:

1. **Check Route Format**: Ensure routes follow the `startingstation-destination` format
2. **Check Admin Station**: Ensure admin stations match the starting station names (case-insensitive)
3. **Run Diagnostic Script**: Use `diagnose_station_filtering.php` to identify issues

### Common Issues:

1. **Route Format**: "Litein-Nairobi" instead of "litein-nairobi"
2. **Extra Spaces**: " litein-nairobi " instead of "litein-nairobi"
3. **Missing Dash**: "liteinnairobi" instead of "litein-nairobi"

The system now correctly filters bookings based on the starting station of the journey, which is more accurate than using a separate boarding point field.
