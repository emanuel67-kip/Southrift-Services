## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive driver location sharing system where drivers can share their live location with passengers assigned to them.

## âœ… Features Implemented

- **Feature**: Automatic notification system
- When location sharing starts/stops:
  - Finds all passengers with bookings assigned to this driver

### 6. **Passenger Profile Integration**
