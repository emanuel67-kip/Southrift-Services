# Station-Based Booking Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds station-based filtering to the admin section so that admins can only see bookings originating from their specific station/office. This prevents admins from different stations from seeing each other's bookings, improving data privacy and organizational efficiency.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes
- Added a `station` column to the `users` table to identify which station each admin is assigned to
- The column allows NULL values for flexibility

### 2. Authentication System
- Modified `Admin/auth.php` to fetch and store the admin's station in the session
- The station information is retrieved when the admin logs in and stored in `$_SESSION['admin_station']`

### 3. Booking Filtering
- Updated `Admin/today_bookings.php` to filter bookings based on the admin's station
- The query now includes a condition: `AND boarding_point = 'Station Name'` when the admin has a station assigned
- Only bookings where the passenger's boarding point matches the admin's station will be displayed

### 4. Admin Management
- Created `Admin/manage_admin_stations.php` to allow super admins to assign stations to admins
- Added a new card to the admin dashboard for easy access to station management

## How It Works

### For Passengers
When a passenger makes a booking:
1. They select their boarding point (e.g., "Litein", "Nairobi", "Kisumu")
2. The booking is stored in the database with that boarding point

### For Admins
When an admin views today's bookings:
1. The system checks the admin's assigned station from their user record
2. The booking query is filtered to only show bookings where the boarding point matches the admin's station
3. Admins only see bookings originating from their station

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Passenger from Litein to Nairobi
- Passenger books a trip with boarding point "Litein"
- Only admins stationed at "Litein" will see this booking
- Admins at "Nairobi", "Kisumu", etc. will NOT see this booking

### Scenario 2: Passenger from Nairobi to Kisumu
- Passenger books a trip with boarding point "Nairobi"
- Only admins stationed at "Nairobi" will see this booking
- Admins at "Litein", "Kisumu", etc. will NOT see this booking

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Update
Run the updated `Database/tables/users.sql` script to add the station column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN station VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL;
```

### 2. Assign Stations to Admins
Use the admin interface at `Admin/manage_admin_stations.php` to assign stations to admins, or run SQL queries directly:

```sql
UPDATE users SET station = 'Nairobi' WHERE id = 1 AND role = 'admin';
UPDATE users SET station = 'Litein' WHERE id = 2 AND role = 'admin';
```

### 3. Testing
Run `test_station_filtering.php` to verify the implementation works correctly.

## Benefits
1. **Data Privacy**: Admins only see relevant bookings for their station
2. **Organizational Efficiency**: Reduces clutter and improves focus
3. **Scalability**: Easy to expand to new stations
4. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to bookings from other stations

## Future Enhancements
1. Add automatic station detection based on admin login location
2. Implement station-based reporting and analytics
3. Add station-specific vehicle assignments
4. Create station manager roles with additional permissions
